# VisualSelectionSort
The purpose of this program is to visually see how the Selection Sort Algorithm works. 
This program was written using the pygame library. This entails using random values 
to generate bars of different length. These vertical bars will then go through a selection
sort algorithm which is incorporated within the gameloop itself. The FPS is restricted to 
increase a user friendly viewing experience. 

Strictly, this program has been for learning the Selection Sort Algorithm and being 
able to implement that into a viewable experience. More details about the program 
can be found within the code documentation.
